How To Play
Run 2 exe files choose one to be the server and one to be the client. the controls for each player are W,A,S,D. you have to be tabbed into whatever window you want to play on.

I used SFML 2.5.1 and winsock 2 to create this game so if there are any linker issues youll need to go into the project settings and link the external libraries.
